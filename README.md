# github-finder

This is one of the project of a 15 Project Series made by Codesistency on Youtube. I'm currently learning by following along with this YouTube video, which covers a HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm taking notes, coding along, adding my own touch to it and documenting what I learn here in this repository. This is a work in progress as I continue watching and practicing each section.

GitHub User Finder is a simple web application that allows you to search for any GitHub user and instantly view their profile details and latest repositories. Just enter a username, and the app fetches information like avatar, bio, location, company, followers, and more, along with a list of their most recent repositories. It’s built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a clean and responsive design. Perfect for quickly exploring GitHub profiles without leaving your browser!

Personally this is also one of my favourite projects apart from the expense tracker in this series. I learnt a lot about the github api, how to fetch data using async functions, storing it in response variable and using it further, collecting and manipulating the data from the api and the UI and it's responsiveness was a plus.
